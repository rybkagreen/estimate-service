# Test Environment Setup Summary

## âœ… Task Completed Successfully

I have successfully set up a complete test environment infrastructure for the Estimate Service project. Here's what was created:

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.test.yml`)
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Database server on port 5433
- **Redis 7**: Cache and session management on port 6380
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible file storage on ports 9001 (API) and 9002 (Console)
- Custom bridge network for inter-service communication
- Health checks for all services
- Persistent volumes for data storage

### 2. Environment Variables (`.env.test`)
- Test-specific database configuration
- Redis connection settings with password authentication
- MinIO access credentials
- Application configuration for testing
- JWT and session secrets for test environment

### 3. Database Initialization Scripts
- `scripts/init-db/01-init-schema.sql`: Creates extensions and schema
- `scripts/init-db/02-seed-test-data.sql`: Seeds test users, projects, and files
- Test users created with known credentials (password: `testpass123`)

### 4. Management Tools
- `scripts/test-env.sh`: Bash script to start, stop, restart, reset, and monitor services
- `scripts/verify-test-env.js`: Node.js script to verify all services are working
- Both scripts are executable and ready to use

### 5. Documentation
- `docs/test-environment.md`: Comprehensive guide for using the test environment
- Includes troubleshooting tips and CI/CD integration examples

### 6. Example Test File
- `tests/example.test.ts`: Demonstrates how to use all three services in tests
- Shows integration testing patterns

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start the test environment
./scripts/test-env.sh start

# Verify everything is working
node scripts/verify-test-env.js

# View service status
./scripts/test-env.sh status

# Stop the environment
./scripts/test-env.sh stop
```

## Service Access Points

- **PostgreSQL**: `postgresql://testuser:testpass@localhost:5433/testdb`
- **Redis**: `redis://:testredispass@localhost:6380`
- **MinIO API**: `http://localhost:9001`
- **MinIO Console**: `http://localhost:9002` (Login: minioadmin/minioadmin123)

## Key Features

1. **Isolation**: Uses different ports to avoid conflicts with development services
2. **Automation**: Automatic database initialization and bucket creation
3. **Health Checks**: All services have health checks configured
4. **Test Data**: Pre-seeded with users, projects, and file records
5. **Network Security**: Services communicate over a dedicated Docker network
6. **Persistence**: Data volumes ensure data survives container restarts

The test environment is now ready for use in automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and local development testing.
